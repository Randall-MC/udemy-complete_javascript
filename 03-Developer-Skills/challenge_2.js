/* 
Let's say you're building a time tracking application for freelancers. At some point in building this app, you need a function that receives daily work hours for a certain week, and returns:
1. Total hours worked
2. Average daily hours
3. The day with the most hours worked
4. Number of days worked
5. Whether the week was full-time (worked 35 hours or more)

TEST DATA: [7.5, 8, 6.5, 0, 8.5, 4, 0]
*/

/* 
----- 1. Understanding the Problem 
Create a function that receives an array which contains the daily work hours for a certain week

----- 2. Divide and conquer
- Get total hours worked
- Get average
- Get the day with the most hours worked
- Get the number of days worked (ignore days with 0 hours worked)
- Get if the week was full-time (worked 35 hours or more)

----- 3. Do some research, don't be silly

----- 4. Write pseudocode before you write the real one
